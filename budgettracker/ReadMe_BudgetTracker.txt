The BudgetTracker class keeps track of the balance and a list of transactions. 
Each transaction is stored as a dictionary with a type (Income or Expense), amount, and description.
The add_income and add_expense methods adjust the balance accordingly and log the transaction.
The show_balance method prints the current balance.
The show_transactions method prints a list of all transactions.
The main function provides a simple text-based interface for interacting with the budget tracker. 
Users can add income or expenses, view the current balance, view all transactions, or exit the program.
