I created this java program to demonstrate some of the very first basic Java programming concepts I had learned in 2022 which 
include input handling, conditional logic with a switch statement, and arithmetic operations.   

This Java application is a simple calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations: 
addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. 
The user is prompted to enter two numeric values followed by the desired operation. 
The application then displays the result of the operation.

## How to Run
- Ensure you have Java installed on your machine.
- Compile the Calculator.java file using `javac Calculator.java`.
- Run the compiled class with `java Calculator`.
- Follow the on-screen prompts to input numbers and an operation.

## Features
- Supports basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /).
- User-friendly prompts for inputting numbers and choosing an operation.
- Error handling for invalid operation inputs.
