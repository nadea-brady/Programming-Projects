This is an implementation of a simple To-Do List application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

This basic version will allow users to add tasks, mark them as done, and delete them. 
For simplicity, this implementation won't use any backend storage, so the tasks will be lost once the page is refreshed.
